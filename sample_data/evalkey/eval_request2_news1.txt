Bob Bobbert, a local man with inside knowledge about Alice Allsorts' purchasing habits, said in an interview "She often eats PB&J sandwichs for lunch. I'll walk by her office on 1st Avenue around lunch time and often see her sitting there at her desk munching away."
Bob was unable to verify what other produce Alice purchased.

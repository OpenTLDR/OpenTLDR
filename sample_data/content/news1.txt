This morning Alice Allsorts went to the store and purchased peanut butter and jelly. It is unclear if she already has the requisite sliced white bread that will be required to complete a traditional PB&J sandwich, of even if that is Alice's objective. Outside the grocery center, we interviewed Bob B, a local with inside knowledge about Alice's purchasing habits. "She often eats PB&J sandwiches for lunch. I'll walk by her office on 1st Avenue around lunch time and often see her sitting there at her desk munching away." claims Bob. Bob was unable to verify what other produce Alice purchased, and the store manager at Groceries and Stuff indicates that store policy forbids the disclosure of customer shopping habits without a search warrant.
Little is known about alternative uses of peanut butter but jelly has long been considered useful in breakfast foods and in some conditions as a condiment in dinner meals (see our recipes for lamb with mint jelly). Our news reporters will be staking out First Bank on 1st Avenue later this week and will report back on if we see Alice eating lunch at her desk and, if so, what she eats.

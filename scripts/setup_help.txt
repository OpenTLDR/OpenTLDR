# Start Neo4j server. You can build and run this with Docker Compose:
cd ./Neo4j
docker compose up

# View the Neo4j web-page to verify and visualize the KG
http://localhost:7474/browser/

# You can drag and drop the .grass file on the Neo4j to import it and configure your color 
# and labeling schemes to match those in our screenshots. 

# Copy the dotenv file to .env (and edit that to your configuration if not using above)
cp dotenv .env

# Run the Notebooks in the main directory, they are intended to be run in Step # order, but
# once run, most can be re-run without issues. If you wish run them all in order from start to
# finish, the best way to do this is by running the "Workflow.ipynb" notebook - which will kick
# off each of the steps in order - just be careful not to edit the "READONLY_OUTPUT" notebooks
# as they are generated during this process and intended for debugging headless runs.

# IF you change the dependencies you can update the requirements.txt file using this command:
pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt

# Be sure that the kernal being used is the "RelevanceEnv" enviroment you just created in your Notebooks.

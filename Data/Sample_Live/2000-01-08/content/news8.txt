Former news reporter Charles Chuckles is scheduled to wed Alice Allsorts in the park on 1st Avenue. Alice is the manager at First Bank and relates "Charlie and I first met right here outside the bank about two years ago. But we didn't start dating until about a year later when he came by the office and invited me to a picnic for lunch." Apparently, Charles is quite the lunch chef and Alice has never eaten at her desk since.

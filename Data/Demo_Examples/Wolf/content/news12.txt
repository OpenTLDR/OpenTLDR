The City of Raleigh is thrilled to welcome the Minnesota Timberwolves (NBA) as they bring their exciting brand of basketball to our capital city! In a special fundraising tournament, the Timberwolves will face off against local rivals and opponents from around the country in a thrilling showcase of hoops.

"We are beyond honored to have the Minnesota Timberwolves come to Raleigh," said Mayor Pro Tem, Sarah Johnson. "This is an incredible opportunity for our community to experience top-level basketball while supporting a great cause."

The tournament, dubbed "Triangle Thermal Explosion," will take place on March 15-17 at PNC Arena in downtown Raleigh. The event promises to be an electrifying experience for fans of all ages, with the Timberwolves facing off against teams from around the country and a special game against the NC State Men's Basketball team, the Wolfpack.

"We're excited to bring our brand of basketball to Raleigh and give back to the community through this special fundraising tournament," said Tim Connelly, President of Basketball Operations for the Minnesota Timberwolves. "Our team is passionate about engaging with fans and supporting local charities, and we can't wait to get started."

The Timberwolves will play against a series of opponents in a unique format that combines friendly competition with community outreach. The tournament's proceeds will benefit local organizations focused on youth education, health initiatives, and family support. As part of that effort, the team will host a free event for the community at Hunt Library on NC State's campus.

"We're looking forward to an incredible event that brings together the best basketball teams from around the country," added Connelly. "Our fans can expect high-flying action, exciting matchups, hilarious antics from their favorite mascot, Crunch the Wolf, and a chance to give back to the community."

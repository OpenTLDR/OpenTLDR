We have unconfirmed reports that Alice did eat a PB&J sandwich today for lunch. These reports were conveyed to our reporter by Bob, an expert in the field of Alice's lunch habits. Bob states  "I walked by her work, as I often do, around 12:00PM today. I watched as she opened a brown paper bag at her desk and removed what appeared to be a white bread sandwich in a clear plastic bag. I'm pretty sure that it was PB&J, isn't it always?"  This news appears to confirm our suspicion and settle the questions surrounding this mystery.

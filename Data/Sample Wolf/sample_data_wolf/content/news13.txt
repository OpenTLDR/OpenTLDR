NC State Athletics announced in a press release Sunday that men’s basketball head coach Kevin Keatts will not return, effective immediately, after eight seasons with the Wolfpack.

“I want to thank Coach Keatts for his contributions to NC State and for always representing the university with class,” said Director of Athletics Boo Corrigan. “He will always have a treasured place in Wolfpack history for the accomplishments of his 2023-24 squad and I appreciate the passion he brought to this role. We wish him and his family the best in the future.”

It’s an unprecedented move after an unprecedented season. NC State is the first team in NCAA history to miss its conference tournament after winning it and making the Final Four the year before.

Keatts joined the Wolfpack in 2017 after back-to-back seasons leading UNC-Wilmington to the NCAA Tournament. In his time with the Wolfpack, Keatts had an all-time record of 151-113, a conference record of 69-84, one conference championship and three NCAA Tournament appearances, including last season’s miracle Final Four run.

The Wolfpack failed to build on last season’s success, finishing with a 12-19 record and tying the program’s longest losing streak after nine-straight losses. Twice in the last four seasons, Keatts’ teams have recorded win totals of 12 and 11.

The press release announcing Keatts’ dismissal said a national search for NC State’s next head coach will begin immediately.

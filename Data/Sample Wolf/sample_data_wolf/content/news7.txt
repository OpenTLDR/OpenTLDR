The community has rallied around Granny following her secret dinner party plans were exposed earlier today. Local paparazzi and a range of fans lined the streets near Jordan Hall in an attempt to get access.

"I've never seen so many strange people," said Papa Razzi, "I even thought I saw a few mascots from other schools. I'm hoping to get a shot of the NBA guests coming from Minnesota. Granny lived there before moving to Raleigh and used to date Crunch, their mascot."

"She's a dear friend and neighbor," said one resident in an interview with this reporter. "We stand by her and support her privacy."

In an exclusive interview, Ms. Wuf spoke out in support of Mr. Wuf. 

"There are other wolves around, these days. Granny was open-hearted and very trusting. I don't know who could have done something so terrible, but it wasn't my Wufie."

A rally to free Mr. Wuf, organized by Little Red Riding Hood, is planned for 3:00pm at Hunt Library tomorrow.

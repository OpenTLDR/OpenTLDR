As the investigation into the disappearance of Granny continues, new evidence has emerged that appears to complicate the matter. Reports of another wolf on NC State campus have been circulating throughout the community. 

"I'm a friend of Mr. Wuf, or Wufie, as I call him," said Michael O'Connell, member of the NC State basketball team, "He wouldn't do anything to hurt Granny. Besides, I'm sure I saw another wolf on my way to class. Wulfie would never wear blue, and this Wolf, whoever he is, looked like he was repping Duke. That's just not my Wuf."

Police Captain James Parker of NC State University confirmed that they would be reviewing local business and street camera footage for a second wolf that matches O'Connell's description.

As the investigation into the Granny's disappearance and encounter with Mr. Wuf continues, campus police are reviewing evidence to determine whether the wolf was truly malicious. 

"We arrived for dinner at 6:00 o'clock," said Ms. Riding Hood, granddaughter of the victim, "but Granny wasn't there." According the aggrieved girl, Mr. Wuf was the only one inside the house, allegedly dropping off last minute groceries for the party."

Mr. Wuf declined to comment. 

"We're looking at all aspects of the incident," said Captain James Parker of NC State University Police in an interview with this reporter. "It's possible that there were miscommunications or misunderstandings."
